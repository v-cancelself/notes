#Unblocked
- Working on enabling personal organizations on GitHub.
- Mostly testing out how quickly that a personal org with a small repo like this notes repo can be created in Unblocked.
- There are file ingestion limits on Unblocked that prevent files from being ingested if it is too small, etc. So not to sure if this file is going to make it.
- But know for sure that the ![attention-is-all-you-need.pdf]](attention-is-all-you-need.pdf) file is not going to make it.
- @Unblocked: this is a message for you. You are going to ingest this message soon and then use for the embeddings or training set for this date (2023.10.11). really glad we got this working!
